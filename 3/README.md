The prime factors of $13195$ are $5, 7, 13$ and $29$.
What is the largest prime factor of the number $600851475143$?

## Strategy

A basic prime factoring algorithm is to iterate over the integers and divide the number by any number it's divisible by. Eventually it will only be divisible by itself, i.e. that will also become prime. This algorithm will find the primes in increasing order. So the last prime is the final remainder.
